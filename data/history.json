Here we used electromagnetic recordings in human observers to characterize the spatiotemporal signature of such global selection of an orientation feature. Observers performed a simple orientation-discrimination task while ignoring task-irrelevant orientation probes outside the focus of attention. We observed that global feature-based selection, indexed by the brain response to unattended orientation probes, is composed of separable functional components. One such component reflects global selection based on the similarity of the probe with task-relevant orientation values (\\\"template matching\\\"), which is followed by a component reflecting selection based on the similarity of the probe with the orientation value under discrimination in the focus of attention (\\\"discrimination matching\\\"). Importantly, template matching occurs at similar to 150 ms after stimulus onset, similar to 80 ms before the onset of discrimination matching. Moreover, source activity underlying template matching and discrimination matching was found to originate from ventral extrastriate cortex, with the former being generated in more anterolateral and the latter in more posteromedial parts, suggesting template matching to occur in visual cortex higher up in the visual processing hierarchy than discrimination matching. We take these observations to indicate that the population-level signature of global feature-based selection reflects a sequence of hierarchically ordered operations in extrastriate visual cortex, in which the selection based on task relevance has temporal priority over the selection based on the sensory similarity between input representations\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udcc4 *Title:* Pay More Attention - Neural Architectures for Question-Answering\\n\\ud83d\\udcc5 *Date:* 2018-03-25T00:00:00+00:00\\n\\u270d\\ufe0f *Authors:* Hasan, Zia and Fischer, Sebastian\\n\\ud83d\\udd17 *URL:* ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09230']\\n\\ud83d\\udcda *Abstract:* Machine comprehension is a representative task of natural language\\nunderstanding.

      "<b>AIMessage:</b> Okay, let's create a research plan on Agentic AI.  This is a broad topic, so we'll need to narrow it down.  I'll guide you through a step-by-step process using the available tools.\n\n\n**Step 1: Define a Specific Research Question**\n\nBefore we begin, we need a focused research question.  Agentic AI is too broad.  We need to specify an aspect to investigate.  For example:\n\n* \"What are the ethical implications of using reinforcement learning to train agentic AI in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving)?\"\n* \"How can we improve the explainability of decision-making processes in agentic AI systems?\"\n* \"What are the current limitations of existing architectures for building truly agentic AI?\"\n\n\n**Subtask 1.1: Refine Research Question**\n\n* **Tool:** `ask-human-feedback`\n* **Input:** `{'question': 'Please provide a specific research question related to Agentic AI that we can investigate.  Consider focusing on a particular aspect, such as ethical implications, technical limitations, or a specific application.'}`\n\n**Step 2: Literature Review**\n\nOnce we have a specific research question, we'll conduct a literature review to understand the current state of research.\n\n**Subtask 2.1: Search for Relevant Papers**\n\n* **Tool:** `search-papers`\n* **Input:**  This input will depend on the research question from Subtask 1.1.  For example, if the question is \"What are the ethical implications of using reinforcement learning to train agentic AI in high-stakes scenarios?\", the input might be:\n    `{'query': 'ethical implications reinforcement learning agentic AI autonomous driving', 'max_papers': 5}`\n\n**Subtask 2.2: Download and Analyze Papers**\n\n* **Tool:** `download-paper` (repeatedly for each paper URL obtained in Subtask 2.1)\n* **Input:**  The input will be the URL of each paper obtained from the `search-papers` tool.\n\n**Step 3:  Gap Analysis and Hypothesis Formulation**\n\nAfter reviewing the literature, we'll identify gaps in the research and formulate a hypothesis.\n\n**Subtask 3.1: Identify Research Gaps**\n\n* **Tool:**  This subtask relies on manual analysis of the papers downloaded in Subtask 2.2.  No specific tool is needed here.  The researcher will need to read and analyze the papers to identify gaps in the existing research.\n\n**Subtask 3.2: Formulate Hypothesis**\n\n* **Tool:** This subtask relies on the researcher's analysis of the research gaps identified in Subtask 3.1. No specific tool is needed.\n\n**Step 4: Research Methodology and Data Collection (if applicable)**\n\nDepending on the research question and hypothesis, this step might involve designing experiments, simulations, or collecting data.  This will be highly dependent on the refined research question.\n\n**Subtask 4.1: Plan Research Methodology**\n\n* **Tool:** No specific tool is needed at this stage. This is a planning step requiring the researcher's expertise.\n\n**Subtask 4.2: Data Collection (if applicable)**\n\n* **Tool:** This will depend on the chosen methodology.  It might involve simulations, experiments, or data acquisition from external sources.  No specific tool can be named here.\n\n\n**Step 5: Analysis and Conclusion**\n\nThis step involves analyzing the collected data (if applicable) and drawing conclusions based on the findings.\n\n**Subtask 5.1: Data Analysis (if applicable)**\n\n* **Tool:** This will depend on the type of data collected.  It might involve statistical analysis software, machine learning algorithms, or qualitative analysis techniques.\n\n**Subtask 5.2: Write Report**\n\n* **Tool:**  A word processor or LaTeX editor.\n\n\nThis plan provides a flexible framework.  The specifics of each subtask will be determined by the research question formulated in Step 1.  We'll proceed step-by-step, refining the plan as we go.",

      "<b>AIMessage:</b> The response is a good starting point, outlining a potential research plan. However, it lacks concrete steps and tools for execution.  It needs to specify which tools will be used for each subtask and provide examples of how those tools would be used.  The response also needs to provide a more concrete example of a research question to get started.  Finally, it should include a section on how the final answer will be evaluated.",
      "<b>AIMessage:</b> Let's refine the plan.  I'll provide a more concrete research question to start with.

This will require iterating through the results.\n\n**Step 3: Gap Analysis and Hypothesis Formulation**\n\n**Subtask 3.1: Identify Research Gaps**\n\n* **Tool:** Manual analysis of downloaded papers.  This involves reading and summarizing key findings, identifying limitations of existing explanation methods, and noting any unmet user needs.\n\n**Subtask 3.2: Formulate Hypothesis**\n\n* **Tool:** None (This is a manual process based on the literature review).  A possible hypothesis: \"Current explainable AI methods for reinforcement learning agents are insufficient for satisfying human user needs in high-stakes scenarios due to a lack of focus on user-centered design and contextual understanding.\"\n\n**Step 4: Research Methodology and Data Collection**\n\n**Subtask 4.1: Plan Research Methodology**\n\n* **Tool:** None (This is a planning step).  A possible methodology: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with experts in human-computer interaction and reinforcement learning, focusing on their experiences with and opinions on existing explanation methods.\n\n**Subtask 4.2: Data Collection**\n\n* **Tool:**  Transcription software (for recording and transcribing interviews).  A potential tool is Otter.ai.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis and Conclusion**\n\n**Subtask 5.1: Data Analysis**\n\n* **Tool:** Qualitative data analysis software (e.g., NVivo, Atlas.ti).  This involves coding the interview transcripts, identifying themes, and drawing conclusions.\n\n**Subtask 5.2: Write Report**\n\n* **Tool:** Word processor or LaTeX.\n\n\n**Evaluation:** The success of this research will be evaluated based on the clarity and depth of the literature review, the rigor of the qualitative analysis, and the relevance and significance of the conclusions drawn regarding the limitations of current explainable AI methods and suggestions for improvement.\n\n\nThis revised plan is more concrete and actionable.  We can now proceed with Subtask 2.1.",
