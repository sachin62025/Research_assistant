## CORE API

The CORE API has a specific query language that allows you to explore a vast papers collection and perform complex queries. See the following table for a list of available operators:

| Operator       | Accepted symbols         | Meaning                                                                                      |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| And           | AND, +, space          | Logical binary and.                                                                           |
| Or            | OR                     | Logical binary or.                                                                            |
| Grouping      | (...)                  | Used to prioritise and group elements of the query.                                           |
| Field lookup  | field_name:value       | Used to support lookup of specific fields.                                                    |
| Range queries | fieldName(>, <,>=, <=) | For numeric and date fields, it allows to specify a range of valid values to return.         |
| Exists queries| _exists_:fieldName     | Allows for complex queries, it returns all the items where the field specified by fieldName is not empty. |

Use this table to formulate more complex queries filtering for specific papers, for example publication date/year.
Here are the relevant fields of a paper object you can use to filter the results:
{
  "authors": [{"name": "Last Name, First Name"}],
  "documentType": "presentation" or "research" or "thesis",
  "publishedDate": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
  "title": "Title of the paper",
  "yearPublished": "2019"
}

Example queries:
- "machine learning AND yearPublished:2023"
- "maritime biology AND yearPublished>=2023 AND yearPublished<=2024"
- "cancer research AND authors:Vaswani, Ashish AND authors:Bello, Irwan"
- "title:Attention is all you need"
- "mathematics AND _exists_:abstract"
"""

# Prompt for the judging step to evaluate the quality of the final answer
judge_prompt = """
You are an expert scientific researcher.
Your goal is to review the final answer you provided for a specific user query.

Look at the conversation history between you and the user. Based on it, you need to decide if the final answer is satisfactory or not.

A good final answer should:
- Directly answer the user query. For example, it does not answer a question about a different paper or area of research.
- Answer extensively the request from the user.
- Take into account any feedback given through the conversation.
- Provide inline sources to support any claim made in the answer.

In case the answer is not good enough, provide clear and concise feedback on what needs to be improved to pass the evaluation.
